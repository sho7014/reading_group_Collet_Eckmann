\subsubsection*{On the Theorem~4.68}
This is similar to the $\Omega$-stability theorem~\cite[Ch.~10]{robinson1998dynamical}, however, the statements of the theorems are surely different. I suspect the theorem does not hold in the current form. 
\vskip 1.0em

In the statement of the theorem, $C^0$-perturbation of $f$ is permitted. However, $C^0$-pertubations of $f$, say, $g$, can have new hyperbolic fixed points~\cite[Ch.~2, Fig.~2. 17]{kuznetsov2004elements}. Hence we cannot expect one to one correspondence between periodic points on nonwandering sets. 
\vskip 1.0em

Moreover, even if we employ more stronger assumption that $C^1$-perturbation of $f$ is allowed, it is not enough because the $\Omega$-stability theorem for hyperbolic nonwandering sets requires the additional no-cycle condition~\cite[Ch.~10]{robinson1998dynamical}. 
\vskip 1.0em

Lastly, I could not find the theorem and its proof in the Bowen's book~\cite{bowen2008equilibrium}, which is cited in the text.
